Generate bios every minute!  Fill your friends VRCX logs with garbage!  This script does all the above and more!

To use this script, you will need the VRchat Python API.  You can find it at https://github.com/vrchatapi/vrchatapi-python
Before using the script, update the logins.ini file with your username and password for VRC and the organization and API key for OpenAI.  Run in any Python3 environment and enjoy your friends confusion!

The script also features an overly-agressive censor filter.  The implementation of this however will only replace words in the Youtube blacklist with asterisks, including some words which are far from blacklist-worthy.

If you feel like changing the prompt, you can adjust this in the top of the script.  Just be aware that ChatGPT may still use your previous prompts to influence the results of future prompts.
